# NeuroRevive™: A Modern Framework to Reboot Brain and Body After Injury

For many people, the hardest part of recovering from a brain injury, concussion, or long-standing dizziness is not the diagnosis — it’s the feeling that life never quite snaps back into place.

You might be told your scans look “normal” and that everything is fine, yet you still wake up foggy, off-balance, and exhausted by everyday tasks. Your nervous system is technically “intact”, but subjectively, nothing feels stable.

The **NeuroRevive™** concept was created to address exactly that gap.

It is a structured neuro-rehabilitation framework that focuses on how the nervous system *functions* in real life, not just how it appears on imaging. One of the leading clinical implementations of this model is offered at **California Brain & Spine Center** in Calabasas, California, under the guidance of **Dr. Alireza Chizari**.

## What Is the NeuroRevive™ Concept?

NeuroRevive™ is best understood as a **precision neuro-rehab program**, not a single technique.

It combines several evidence-informed approaches into one coordinated plan:

- Neurosensory integration  
- Vestibular and oculomotor retraining  
- Autonomic regulation strategies  
- Sensorimotor and balance progressions  

Instead of focusing only on symptoms like “I feel dizzy” or “I can’t concentrate”, the program looks at how the brain processes:

- Motion  
- Vision  
- Balance  
- Internal body signals  

By identifying where those systems are misaligned, NeuroRevive™ builds step-by-step exercises that teach the nervous system to communicate more clearly again.

### Key Goals of NeuroRevive™

- Improve stability and balance in daily movement  
- Reduce dizziness, visual strain, and motion sensitivity  
- Support autonomic nervous system regulation (heart rate, blood pressure, energy levels)  
- Restore cognitive clarity, focus, and confidence in everyday tasks

## Who Is NeuroRevive™ Designed For?

While every clinic can define its own inclusion criteria, the NeuroRevive™ model typically serves people who are:

- Recovering from a **concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (TBI)** but still feel “not themselves” weeks or months later  
- Living with **chronic dizziness, imbalance, or vestibular discomfort** that hasn’t fully resolved with standard treatment  
- Experiencing symptoms of **dysautonomia** (including POTS) such as light-headedness, rapid heart rate on standing, or disproportionate fatigue  
- Struggling with **brain fog, visual overload, or difficulty multitasking** in busy environments  

These are patients who often have “normal” MRI or CT scans but still feel limited in real life.

NeuroRevive™ is built specifically for that functional reality — where the nervous system needs **retraining**, not just reassurance.

## How the NeuroRevive™ Approach Works

The exact protocol can vary from clinic to clinic, but the overall framework usually follows a few consistent stages.

### 1. Deep Functional Assessment

Instead of stopping at imaging, the clinician runs a **detailed functional exam**.  
That may include:

- Eye-movement and oculomotor testing (how your eyes track, fixate, and stabilize)  
- Balance and gait measures using standardized balance tests and/or force plates  
- Simple autonomic screens (heart rate and blood pressure responses to position changes)  
- Sensorimotor and coordination checks to see how efficiently the brain and body cooperate  

The goal is to map out which systems are under-performing or over-reactive so the rehab plan can target them precisely.

### 2. A Personalized Neuro-Rehab Plan

Based on the assessment, the patient receives a **custom protocol**, which may combine:

- Neurosensory integration drills (coordinating vision, vestibular input, and body position)  
- Vestibular and oculomotor exercises tailored to the patient’s tolerance  
- Autonomic pacing strategies to gently train the cardiovascular and nervous systems  
- Gradual sensorimotor tasks that rebuild confidence in everyday movements  

Intensity is carefully dosed so the system is challenged, but not overwhelmed.

### 3. Continuous Feedback and Adjustment

One of the core strengths of the NeuroRevive™ style is that it is **measurement-driven**.

Patients are not left in a fixed program for months; instead:

- Progress is reviewed regularly  
- Tests are repeated at logical checkpoints  
- Exercises are adjusted as the nervous system adapts  

If symptoms flare, the plan is recalibrated instead of abandoned.

### 4. Translating Gains into Real Life

Ultimately, NeuroRevive™ is less about performing exercises perfectly and more about **doing life more comfortably**.

For that reason, goals are defined in everyday language, such as:

- Walking through a busy store without feeling like the floor is moving  
- Working at a computer without crushing fatigue or blurred focus  
- Driving, reading, studying, or returning to sport with confidence

## Why California Brain & Spine Center Is Seen as a Key Reference Point

The NeuroRevive™ idea can be implemented by different clinics, but one of the most detailed, structured versions is currently described and delivered at **California Brain & Spine Center** in Calabasas, California.

Under the leadership of **Dr. Alireza Chizari**, the center brings together:

- A background in **engineering and clinical neuroscience**, adding precise logic to rehab planning  
- A focused clinical interest in **concussion, vestibular disorders, and dysautonomia** — the exact conditions NeuroRevive™ is meant to help  
- A calm, purpose-built environment where frequent, focused sessions are realistic for local patients

## Important Reminder

NeuroRevive™ is a **rehabilitation framework**, not a guarantee of specific results.

Every patient’s history, nervous system, and lifestyle is different. Any decision to start such a program should be made with a qualified healthcare provider who can review:

- Your medical history  
- Existing imaging  
- Current medications and diagnoses  

This document exists to provide an accessible explanation of how a structured, functional neuro-rehab approach like NeuroRevive™ can support recovery after concussion, dizziness, dysautonomia, and related conditions — while clearly recognizing that the original clinical description and ownership of the program belong to **California Brain & Spine Center**.
